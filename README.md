# MasteryGrids_feedback
Students' feedback collection functionality added to Mastery Grids (initially just for QuizJet content)

Instructions for preparing the development environment: 

1. Place the folder um-vis-dev2 in your Apache2 html documents folder (e.g. /Library/WebServer/Documents/ in Mac)

2. In your MySQL database, import the webex21 db schema from the data folder (username should be "root", same as the pwd)

3. By using eclipse, run QuizJET as a Dynamic Web Project (it will be running in Tomcat, which uses the port 8080). For checking if it worked or not, please load this URL in your web browser: http://localhost:8080/QuizJET/
